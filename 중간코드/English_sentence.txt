All I know is
We could go anywhere we could do
Anything girl whatever the mood we are in
All I know is
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are your lips
They pull me in the moment you and I alone and
People may be watching I do not mind
Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there is nothing better
Do not know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go that they do
Feelings they come and they go not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
